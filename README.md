# Master en React – Udemy Course Repository

This repository contains all the exercises, projects, and examples developed while completing the **Udemy course *"Master en React: Aprender ReactJS, Hooks, MERN, NodeJS, JWT+"***, taught by **Víctor Robles**.

It serves both as a **learning record** and a **technical showcase** of my progression through React and full-stack JavaScript development. Each folder represents a section of the course, covering different concepts, hooks, and progressively larger projects.

## 🎯 Overview

This course provides a complete learning path through modern **React** and the **MERN Stack** (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js). It covers everything from the fundamentals of React components and hooks to building full-stack web applications.

### 🧠 Key topics covered

* React fundamentals (JSX, components, props, events)
* Hooks: `useState`, `useEffect`, `useRef`, `useReducer`, `useContext`, custom hooks, and more
* React Router and SPA navigation
* Context API and state management
* Form handling and validation
* Performance optimization with `useMemo` and `useCallback`
* Backend with Node.js, Express, MongoDB, and JWT authentication
* Building full MERN applications (portfolio, blog, and social network)

## 🧩 About the learning process

Throughout this course, I reinforced JavaScript fundamentals and built a strong understanding of how React applications are structured. Each exercise was designed to deepen my intuition about component design, reactivity, and clean architecture.

The final sections involve creating **full-stack applications**, including a portfolio, blog, and social network, all connected through RESTful APIs built with Node, Express, and MongoDB.
